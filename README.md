## Respiratory: Topographic Mass Effect on Gravity Field Quantities

This repository investigates the contribution of topography to gravity field quantities and its impact on derived measurements. It explores methods for modeling topography and computing its gravitational influence.

**Project Goals:**

* Understand the impact of topography on gravity measurements.
* Develop methods for modeling topography and calculating its gravitational effects.
* Compare approaches for computing orthometric height.

**Methodology:**

* Model topography using a Bouguer plate and rectangular prisms.
* Calculate the topographic contribution to gravity.
* Compare methods for computing orthometric height.

**Data:**

The `data` folder contains input files used for computations:

* `data/dtm.dat` (or similar): Digital Terrain Model (DTM) for a chosen profile.
* `data/gravity_profile.dat` (or similar): Gravity measurements along the profile.
* `data/zugspitze_params.dat` (or similar): Parameters for the Zugspitze example (geopotential number, gravity value).
