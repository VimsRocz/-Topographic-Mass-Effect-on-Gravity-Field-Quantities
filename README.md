# -Topographic-Mass-Effect-on-Gravity-Field-Quantities
This project investigates the contribution of topography to gravity measurements and how it affects various derived quantities. It explores methods for modeling the topography and computing its gravitational influence.
Project Goals:
Understanding the impact of topography on gravity measurements.
Methodology:
Modeling topography with a Bouguer plate and rectangular prisms.
Calculating the topographic contribution to gravity.
Comparing methods for computing orthometric height.
Data:
Description of input data for Zugspitze example (gravity, geopotential number, etc.)
Software:
Programming languages used (e.g., MATLAB)
List of relevant functions (e.g., vprism.m for calculating potential of a prism)
Results:
Expected format (tables, graphs)
Brief summary of key findings
Data Description:

The data folder will contain input files for the computations, including:

Digital Terrain Model (DTM) for the chosen profile
Gravity measurements along the profile
Parameters for Zugspitze example (CP, gp)
Formulae:

Bouguer anomaly formula (Equation 1)
Plumb line definition (Equation 5)
Helmert height formula (Equation 6)
Precise orthometric height formula (Equation 7)
Gravitational potential of a rectangular prism (Equation 9)
